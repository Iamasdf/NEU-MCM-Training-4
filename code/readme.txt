Problem Statement: 
You are given a dataset ("*.h5") containing:
- a training set of train_catvnoncat.h5 file labeled as cat (y=1) or non-cat (y=0)
- a test set of test_catvnoncat.h5 file labeled as cat or non-cat
- each image is of shape (height, width, 3) where 3 is for the 3 channels (RGB).
No.1-3 in the "images" directory are the test images.  Of course, you can also select the other cat or non-cat images freely. 
You will build a simple image-recognition model that can correctly classify pictures as cat or non-cat.
